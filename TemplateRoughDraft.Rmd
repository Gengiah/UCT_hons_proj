 The Research Paper examines the profitability of simple and exponential Moving Averages on 3 different Johannesburg Stock Exchange Indices from 2006-2017. An optimization algorithm is used to determine the best short and long run moving averages. The results provided profits in the training period but provided no profits in the validation period. The results disagreed with the initial evidence of moving averages being profitable.Further research could be performed by testing different moving averages.

# Introduction

Technical analysis involves using the volume and latest stock prices to determine models and technical trading indicators for a given set of data. Moving averages are the most widely known and used by practitioners and financial traders in the markets. [@sobreiro2016profitability]. 

“Moving Average are a type of smoothing method for reducing, or cancelling random variation inherent in data taken over time. When applied properly, this technique reveals more clearly the underlying trend, seasonal and cyclic approach components in the data.” [@okkelsfinancial] This definition implies that moving average can still be used in understanding the direction of the market even if it cannot be used directly in beating the buy-and-hold strategy. Recent studies suggest that moving averages can be used to generate profits. The paper investigates if moving averages are profitable in the South African market.

The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is the biggest stock exchange in Africa. Performing moving average trend line analysis on the 3 different sectors in the JSE creates a greater opportunity to exploit profits in specific economic sectors. The JSE IND is the top 25 industrial companies index in terms of market capitalization, the JSE RESI is the top 10 resource companies index in terms of market capitalization and the JSE FIN is the top 15 financial companies index in the JSE in terms of market capitalization. The industrial, resource and financial sectors are the 3 biggest sectors in South Africa. The paper aims to test moving average trend analysis in these 3 specific sectors. 

Given South Africa’s growing global presence, research on the profitability of moving averages in the South African Market could be utilized for future profits. The paper investigates three different sectors on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, (JSE). The three sectors are the financial, resource and industrial sectors. The paper examines Simple and Exponential moving averages to determine profitability of these three sectors while including transaction costs.

Only one paper has done moving average analysis on South Africa. The paper examined the 5 emerging national economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa using technical analysis (BRICS). [@sobreiro2016profitability] The paper analyzed South Africa but did not cover the South African market extensively. 

The importance of the research question can be split up into a number of specific reasons. The South African stock market is described as weak-form inefficient suggesting profitable opportunities. [@appiah2003return] The lack of information involving moving average trend lines in the South African market and the potential for profits emphasizes the need for Moving Average analysis in the South African Market specific to sectors. There is very little research on moving averages in different sectors. The 3 specific sectors are the biggest in South Africa. Each sector examines unique companies within each sector. 

The Data is explained more in section four. The analysis of each sector could provide crucial information for potential investors and technical traders. Finally, given that the paper is restricted to only simple and exponential moving averages, many of the assumptions underlying technical analysis can be ignored. Section five elaborates more on the assumptions used in the paper and the exact methodology. Section six provides,analyses and tests the results. Section seven is the conclusion.

#Background

## The beginning of technical analysis

Technical analysis was first introduced by Charles H. Dow. Charles H. Dow believed stock market prices could provide information on the overall market. This lead to Dow theory which was introduced in the late 1800’s starting what is known as technical analysis.[@bessembinder1998market] Technical analysis is used in the financial industry amongst different market participants. The introduction of the Efficient Market Hypothesis proposed by Fama [-@malkiel1970efficient] lead to a decline in the use of technical analysis and the disbelief that profits could be generated from technical analysis. [@sobreiro2016profitability] In 1992, William Brock, Josef Lakonishok and Blake LeBaron provided significant evidence in justifying the use of technical analysis. [@fong2005chasing] The paper found signifcant evidence that simple trading rules provide economically and statistically significant returns. Moving averages in particualr outperformed the buy-and-hold to the resurgence in testing technical analysis in different markets and determining whether it is actually profitable.

## The Efficient Market Hypothesis

The paper rewritten by [@fama1991efficient] refers to the Efficient Market Hypothesis as the asset prices fully reflecting all available information. The Efficient Market Hypothesis can be split into 3 forms based on the definition of the information:

1.	Weak Form EMH: Prices reflect all information in the past price history

2.	Semi-Strong Form EMH: Prices reflect all publicly available information

3.	Strong Form EMH: Prices reflect all information, public and private. 
[@park2007we]

If all information is available in the prices, then additional information such as moving averages shouldn’t provide any financial profitability. The Weak form efficient market hypothesis states that there is no justification for technical analysis.  This implies that markets are efficient and arbitrage should not be attainable through technical analysis. [@fama1991efficient]. 
The weak form of the efficient market hypothesis has been the paradigm in describing the behaviour of prices in speculative market. A paper done in 1988 proved the non-existence of random walks in the stock market using the NYSE-AMEX index. [@lo1988stock]
The Efficient Market Hypothesis is one of the main reasons why individuals do not regard technical analysis as useful and has lead market participants to avoid technical analysis. Technical analysis is still used by market participants. Moving averages might not provide exact profits but they do provide other information about the data.

## Moving Averages

The simple and exponential moving averages are the most frequently used moving averages and are used in different ways to predict the buy and sell signals in the price history. Exponential moving average gives more weight to recent stock prices while simple provides equal weighting for all stock prices in a given time period. [@okkelsfinancial]. One method is the comparison of short and long run simple moving averages. Short and long run moving averages refers to the specific time frame in which the moving average is calculated. In a paper done on South Asian markets, short is referred to as 10, 20 or 50 day moving averages, while long run is referred to as 50,100 or 200 day moving averages. [@ming2006profitability]
Moving average techniques require buy and sell signals after comparing short and long run simple or exponential moving averages. [@gunasekarage2001profitability]. The paper discusses two moving average techniques which are: Variable length moving average and fixed length moving average. The variable length moving average rule generates a buy-and-sell signal every day.  Variable length moving average signals to buy when short moving average is above the long moving average. The crossing over of Moving averages is referred to as the dual moving average crossover. [@ming2006profitability].
The variable length moving average is written as VMA(S,L,B) where S is the short moving average, L is the long moving average and B is the band that allows the actual buying and selling signal to occur. B is written as a percentage. B is important as it allows us to know when we should or should not purchase. B is in line with transaction costs[@bessembinder1998market]. 
The fixed length moving average holds a moving average for a fixed period of time. This is a 10-day holding period in Brock [-@brock1992simple] and Ming-Ming, L & Siok-Hwa, L [-@ming2006profitability]. During this 10-day period signals do not change the fixed length moving average till the end of the holding period, where cumulative profits are calculated. Fixed length moving average focuses on crossing over of long and short moving averages. A sell (buy) signal occurs when the short (long) moving average crosses the long (short) moving average from above.
Moving Average strategies require:

$$ Profit( After transaction  costs) = (mean return * number of trades) - (transaction costs) $$
The above strategy provides the profit in percentages. The strategy prevents using exact monetary values and accounts for transaction costs.[@ming2006profitability] The strategy is simple to use and requires complete investment of funds into each signal. The research paper will follow a similar strategy in determining the profitability of moving averages.


## Empirical results 

Brock [-@brock1992simple] analysed fixed and variable moving averages in the Dow Jones industrial Average Index using 90 years of data. (1897-1986). Both the fixed and variable moving averages provided excess returns compared to the buy-and-hold strategy. These returns did not include transaction costs. 


6 equity indices in Asia were analysed and provided results indicating strong predictive power of moving averages in Malaysian, Thailand and Taiwan stock markets. The Results confirm the profitability of moving average trend lines.[@bessembinder1998market] The study obtained stock price index data from (1975-1989). The returns are computed as changes in log price indices thus preventing autocorrelation. The transaction costs were reported as break even costs in order to calculate the highest percentage of profits available for transaction costs. The average transaction cost is 1.57% for the whole sample. If the transaction cost were 1% then moving averages would have been profitable.


Ming-Ming & Siok-Hwa used the daily closing price index as the short term moving average. [-@ming2006profitability] The long term moving average varies between the time period of 20, 60,120,180,240 days.  Multiple long moving averages are compared to the daily closing price index. The results concluded that the best strategy was using a 60-day long moving average and the daily closing price index. The results indicated variable moving averages were more profitable than fixed moving average and both provided significant returns.

The variable moving average requires multiple buy and sell signals until the short moving average crosses the long moving average. The research paper will only focus on fixed moving averages thus limiting the number of buy and signals.

#Data

The data chosen for the study involves using closing prices from 2006 to 2017. The closing prices are split into two categories.The first set of closing prices are over an 8-year period from 1st of May, 2006 to 31st of April 2014. The first set of closing prices is the training period. This period allows us to generate an optimal moving average strategy. The validation period test will occur between the 1st of May 2014 to 31st of April 2017. The second period allows us to test if our training period moving average strategy is still profitable out-of-sample.All data is taken from Google Finance and focuses on the JSE Top10 Resource companies, JSE Top25 industrial companies and the JSE top15 financial companies.

The Transaction cost used consists of 4 aspects: 
Brockerage fee= 0.6%

Investor protection levy = 0.0002% 

STRATE fee= 0.005459% 

Security Transfer Tax=0.25%

The total transaction costs = 0.855659%.[@FNB]

The closing prices used from Google finance are log prices.The R package quantmod is used to collect the data from google finance and convert prices to log returns.The returns referred to in the paper are the log-returns. To avoid autocorrelation daily log returns were used to calculate profits rather than the actual closing prices.

# Methodology

The two Moving Averages used in this reasearch paper are simple moving averages and exponential moving averages. 

##Simple Moving Average

Simple moving averages is the sum of latest stock prices divided by the number of stock prices:
Simple moving average calculation

$$SMA_n= \frac{1}{k} \times \sum_{t = n-k +1}^{n}P_t$$ 


Where:
$P_t$ is the closing price of the stock in t period.  
$n$ is the relative position of the current period observed;   and
$k$ is the number of periods included in the SMA calculation;

Simple averages are the easiest to interpret while exponential moving averages provide stronger predictive ability in market prices. Exponential moving averages focus on the most recent values and thus are similar to weighted moving averages.

##Exponential Moving Average 

$$EMA_n =\Bigg(\frac{2}{k+1}\Bigg) \times P_{t-1} + \Bigg(1- \Bigg(\frac{2}{k+1}\Bigg)\Bigg) \times EMA_{n-1}$$
where:
${P_{t-1}}$ is the closing price of the stock in the previous period.  
$EMA_{n-1}$ is the EMA in the previous period.  
$n$ is the relative position of the current period observed; 
and

$k$ is the number of periods included in the EMA calculation;

The Research project will only focus on simple and exponential moving average trend lines. Moving Average Convergence Divergence is the formal name for comparing a short and long run exponential moving average. 
The simple and exponential moving averages were calculated using the TTR package in R.[]  
The Methodology that will be incorporated in answering the research question is the application of dual moving average crossover and moving average convergence divergence. This allows for short and long term moving averages while comparing simple and exponential moving averages. The literature reviewed suggests using a short moving average of either 5,10,30 or 50 days and long moving average of either 50,100 or 200 days. 	
The exact methodology will be explained in a step by step algorithm how to test the profitability of moving averages in different sectors. The algorithm is used for both simple and exponential moving averages.

Algorithm: 
$$Moving\ average\ function\ =\ function(Data,short,long,cost) $$
..*Data is the actual data from each sector we are analysing and the exact time frame. The data is split into a training period and a validation period.
..*Short is the short run moving average 
..*Long is the long run moving average 
..*Cost is the actual transaction cost = 0.855659%


The exact methodology of the function will be explained in a step by step process. The function is used seperately for simple and exponential moving averages. The only change is that the short and long moving average must either be a simple or exponential moving average.  The research paper does not test short and long run moving averages of different natures. 

1. The function compares the short and long run moving averages by generating signals to indicate whether a buy or sell signal should occur. If the short run moving average is greater than the long run moving average a buy signal is generated. A sell signal occurs if the long run moving average is greater than the short run moving average. A signal is also generated to hold our position, if the short and long run moving averages are equal.

2. The function takes these signals and determines the exact days we will trade in our data set. The data now has signals for each day in which either a buy,sell or hold our position will occur. The function also tracks the number of buy and sell signals.

3. The log returns of a buy and hold strategy are then generated for the specific data set. 

4. The transaction cost are minused from each buy signals log return generating the complete buy returns. These buy returns are added to the sells signals log returns to generate the total return.

5.The function plots a table with the short moving average, long moving average, strategy returns,strategy standard deviation, strategy sharpe ratio, buy and hold return, buy and hold standard deviation and the buy and hold strategy sharpe ration
$$Simple\ Moving\ Average\ Function=\ function(JSEFIN,30,355,0.855659) $$
The Simple moving average function calculates the returns, standard deviation and sharpe ratio for a simple moving average for the JSE Top15 financial companies using a short moving average of 30 days, long moving average of 355 days and a transaction cost of 0.855659%. The function also calculates the returns, standard deviation and sharpe ratio for the buy and hold strategy in the JSE Top25 financial companies. The function can also be used to calculate exponential moving averages. Section 5 provides tables of the results.
$$Exponential\ Moving\ average\ function\ =\ function(Data,short,long,cost) $$
The exponential function differs to the simple moving average function in the fact that the short and long run moving average are calculated only using exponential moving averages.

A sequence using the moving average function was run to generate different values for the short and long periods. The short periods ranged from five to fifty-five days in steps of twenty-five days while the long periods ranged from fifty-five to four hundred and five days in steps of fifty. The sequence generates twenty-four moving averages for either simple or exponential moving average. The empirical results will only look at the top six strategies to determine if any strategies are profitable.

The sequence will be run for simple and exponential moving averages in the 3 different sectors which will result in six tables of data analysis.

Back testing is used in the training period to calculate the optimal strategy for each JSE index using simple and exponential moving averages. The Best strategy for each moving average in our training period will be tested in a validation period to ensure the results were not over optimized to match the specific training period.This prevents inaccurate results and verifies whether the optimal strategy is in fact optimal in different time periods.

# Empirical results

The empirical results for the best strategies in the training periods are plotted in the tables below."short" is the number of days used in the short run moving average. "long" is the number of days used in the long run moving average. "strat_return" is the overall return generated from the strategy of short and long run moving averages. "strat_sd" is the standard deviation for the strategy. "strat_sharpe" is the sharpe ratio for the specific moving average strategy. "bh" referes to the buy-and-hold strategy. "Buy" is the number of buys that occur due to the strategy. "sells" is the number of sells that occur due to the strategy throughtout the investment period.

kable(tablefin, caption = "**Table to show the top 6 strategies in the JSE Top15 Financial companies using a simple moving average between 2006-2014**")
```


The best strategy is a thirty short day moving average and a two hundred and five day long run moving average. The profit generated is 0.0456% higher than the buy-and-hold strategy.The sequence generated five profitable moving average strategies. This return is considerably higher than the buy-and-hold strategy. The optimal moving average strategy has less volatility and more return resulting in a higher sharpe ratio.The strategy is highly profitable but will have to be tested out of sample in order to be validated.

Need to analyse all the results. cyclical pattern of behavior. This is also true for utility companies, which have steady demand for their product year-to-year, but experience strong seasonal changes.

<!-- Interesting facts about moving average. 1. The 21-day moving average commonly marks the short-term trend, the 50-day moving average the intermediate trend, and the 200-day moving average the long-term trend of the market. The SPY is generally the best tracking ETF for the market in general.-->

The Best Simple Moving Average strategy for the JSE Top40 with a short period of 30 days and a long period of 355 days did not beat the buy-and-hold strategy. This could be accounted for by the 16 trades that occurred. The transaction costs overall could have resulted in less profit than the buy-and-hold strategy.

The Best Simple Moving Average strategy for the JSE IND with a short period of 5 days and a long period of 355 days exceeded the buy-and-hold strategy by 0.0054. The profit is rather small but if leveraged correctly could be worth investing in.
The Best Simple Moving Average strategy for the JSE FIN with a short period of 30 days and a long period of 205 days did outperform the buy-and-hold strategy by 0.0462. The profit is considerably high and is worth investing in.
All the Best Exponential Moving Average strategies in the 3 JSE indices outperformed the buy-and-hold strategy. The Exponential Moving average captures shorter trend moves as it generally has a trend line closer to the closing prices due to the use of most recent prices.

The Red Line indicates the long moving average in each indice

Given the chart series graphs its seen that there was minimal change in prices throughout the in-sample period resulting in the exponential moving average matching prices quite accurately causing more profit.

<!-- want to add more empirical results.I still have a lot of additional analysis to perform on all the different statistics--> 

![Table to show the top strategy returns and standard deviations compared to the buy and hold returns and standard deviation and the number of buy and sell trades out-of-sample.](out-of-sample results.png)

The out-of-sample period starts from 1st April 2014 and ends on the 31st of March 2017. Observing the prices using the chart series suggests that prices are more volatile in the out-of-sample period.
All the strategies failed to beat the buy and hold strategy out-the-sample.
This could either be due to Moving averages being unable to beat the buy-and-hold strategy or the increased volatility in the out-of-sample period

\newpage

# Conclusion

The best strategies out of sample all failed to beat the buy-and-hold strategy. This follows the weak form Efficient Market Hypothesis. The in-sample results only beat the buy and hold strategy as the moving averages were over optimized to the curves. Moving Averages are useful in determining trends but cannot be utilized to achieve additional profits. An issue that occurred could be the mismatch between out-of-sample and in-sample strategies having different time lengths. In-sample only had 3 years while out of sample had 8 years. This is due to the fact that only a limited amount of data is available.

(Good point Joe, there are many ways a TA can use MAs to provide entries and exits. And they do work best during a strong trend, as when the market is sideways you would get many entries and exits and lose money. That is why the entry you have suggested is a more aggressive entry (as you don't know if it will be the start of an uptrend or still trading in the band ))
